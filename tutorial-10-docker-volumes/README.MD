# Docker Tutorial 10 - Stateful Conatiners Vs Stateless Containers 

1. Stateless Container means container will not remember the data which got generated by that container. When we re-create the new container we will loose old data.

2. By default docker containers are stateless containers.

3. In previous chapter springboot application when we recreate the containers we lost our old data database which we inserted through application.  (This is not accepted in the realtime).

4. Even if we deploy latest code or if we re-create the containers we should not loose our old data. Our data should remain in the database.

5. If we don't want to loose the data even if we re-create the container then we need to make our Docker Container as Statefull Container.

6. To make Docker Containers as statefull, we need to use Docker Volumes.

## <ins>Docker Volume</ins>

1. Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

2. We have 3 types of volumes in Docker

			1) <ins>Anonymous Volumes</ins> (without name)

			2) <ins>Named Volumes</ins> (Will have a name) ----> Recommended

			3) <ins>Bind Mounts</ins> ( Storing on Host Machine )

### Q: <ins>What is Dangling volume in Docker ?</ins>

1.  The volumes which are created but not associated to any container are called as Dangling Volumes

```
	# Delete all dangling volumes
	$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true)
```


#### <ins>Delete all dangling volumes</ins>
`$ docker-compose u$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true)`

#### <ins>Create Docker volume</ins>
`$ docker volume create <vol-name>`

#### <ins>Display all docker volumes</ins>
`$ docker volume ls`

#### <ins>Inspect Docker Volume</ins>
`$ docker volume inspect <vol-name>`

#### <ins>Delete docker volume</ins>
` docker volume rm <vol-name>`

#### <ins>Delete all docker volumes</ins>
`docker system prune --volumes`
