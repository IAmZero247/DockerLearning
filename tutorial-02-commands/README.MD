### Container Commands

1.	<ins>To see the list of all running continers</ins>
 
	  `docker  container  ls` 
	  
	  `docker ps`
	  
2.	<ins>To see the list of running and stopped containers</ins>
 
  `docker   ps -a` 
  
      
4.	<ins>Run docker image</ins>
 
      `docker run  <image_name/image_id>`    
	  
4.	To start a container
 
      `docker  start  container_name/container_id`
	  
5.	To stop a running container 

      `docker stop   container_name/container_id`
	  
5.	To restart a running container 

      `docker restart container_name/container_id` 
	  
6.	To restart after 10 seconds 

      `docker restart  -t  10  container_name/container_id` 
	  
7.	To delete a stopped container 

      `docker  rm  container_name/container_id` 
	  
8.	To delete a running container 

      `docker  rm  -f  container_name/container id` 
	  
9.	To stop all running containers
 
      `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)` 

10.	To restart all containers
 
	  `docker restart $(docker ps -aq)` 
	  
11.	To remove all stopped containers
 
      `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)` 
	  
12.	To remove all contianers(running and stopped)
 
       `docker rm -f  $(docker ps -aq)` 
	   
13.	To see the logs generated by a container
 
      `docker logs container_name/container_id`
	  
14.	To see the ports used by a container 

      `docker port container_name/container_id`
	   
15.	To get detailed info about a container
 
      `docker inspect container_name/container_id` 
	   
16.	To go into the shell of a running contianer which is moved into background
 
      `docker attach container_name/container id`
	   
17.	To execute any command in a container
 
      `docker exec -it container_name/container_id command`
	  
	  ```
      Eg: To launch the bash shell in a container 
      docker exec -it container_name/container_id    bash 
	  ```
      
18.	To create a container from a docker image  ( imp )

      `docker run image_name`
	  
      ```   
	  Run command options 
	  *	-it  -> For opening an interactive terminal in a container 
	  *	--name -> Used for giving a name to a container 
	  *	-d -> Used for running the container in detached mode as a background process 
	  *	-e -> Used for passing environment variables to the container 
	  *	-p -> Used for port mapping between port of container with the docker host port.
	  *	-P -> Used for automatic port mapping ie, it will map the internal port of the container with some port on host machine. 
				( This host port will be some number greater than 30000 )
	  *	-v -> Used for attaching a volume to the container 
	  *	--volume-from 	-> Used for sharing volume between containers 
	  *	--network -> Used to run the contianer on a specific network 
	  *	--link -> Used for linking the container for creating a multi container architecture 
	  *	--memory  -> Used to specify the maximum amount of ram that the container can use
	  ```
